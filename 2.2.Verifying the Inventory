When in doubt, use the ansible command to verify a machine's presence in the inventory:
[user@controlnode ~]$ ansible washington1.example.com --list-hosts
hosts (1):
washington1.example.com
[user@controlnode ~]$ ansible washington01.example.com --list-hosts
[WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available
hosts (0):
---------------
You can run the following command to list all hosts in a group:
[user@controlnode ~]$ ansible canada --list-hosts
hosts (2):
ontario01.example.com
ontario02.example.com

//
IMPORTANT
If the inventory contains a host and a host group with the same name, the ansible
command prints a warning and targets the host. The host group is ignored.
There are various ways to deal with this situation, the easiest being
to ensure that
host groups do not use the same names as hosts in the inventory.
